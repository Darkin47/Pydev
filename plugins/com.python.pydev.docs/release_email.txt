PyDev 5.2.0 Released

Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

* **Important** PyDev now requires Java 8 and Eclipse 4.5 onwards.

    * PyDev 4.5.5 is the last release supporting Java 7 and Eclipse 3.8.
    * See: `update sites page`_ for the update site of older versions of PyDev.
    * See: the **PyDev does not appear after install** section on `the download page`_ for help on using a Java 8 vm in Eclipse.

* Inital support for code-completion using **PEP 484 static type declarations**.

* **Debugger**

    * Fixed racing condition where the variables view would not be properly shown in the debugger -- which made an additional select of the stack required in order to show the variables (#PyDev-672).
    * Reusing the existing stack from the thread in the debugger (so that the expanded state of the variables is properly kept on step over).
    * Fixed issue changing attribute of local variable in the variables view (#PyDev.Debugger-56).
    * Fixed issue on attach to process: it required the pydevd_tracing to be at the top-level and it was moved to _pydevd_bundle (restored it to be a public API).

* **Indentation**

    * The default indent mode now changed to better follow PEP 8 guidelines:

        * Indenting directly after {, [, ( will add one indent level.
        * Indenting after another token in a line with a {, [, ( will indent to the {, [, ( level.

    * It's possible to restore previous indent modes (which either always indented to the parenthesis level or always indented a single level) in the preferences > PyDev > Editor > Typing.

* **Interactive console**

    * IPython 5 now supported in interactive console (#PyDev-710).
    * Fixed issue executing single line with multiple statements in console.
    * Fixed issue executing a multiple line statement in Jython.

* **Others**

    * The (fast) parser which detects the outline of a Python module now handles mixed indentation (and additional fixes which could result in log entries such as "Did not expect to find item below node: Assign...").
    * Support for unpacking generalizations (PEP 448) which could still result in a syntax error for the Python 3 grammar (#PyDev-701).
    * Fixed error in code analysis when the code is connected to an RTC source control (#PyDev-184, patch by Wesley Barroso Lopes)
