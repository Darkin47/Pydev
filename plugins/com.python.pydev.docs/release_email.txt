PyDev 4.5.1 Released

Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

* Debugger

	* Cython speedup modules are now available for the debugger (see performance improvements at: https://www.speedtin.com/reports/7_pydevd_cython).

	* It is considerably faster even without the speedup modules (see performance improvements at: https://www.speedtin.com/reports/8_pydevd_pure_python).

	* When debugging multiple processes the console wasn't being updated to the selected stack in the debug view.

	* Many bug-fixes.

* Improved the search to always play safe and update the index so that the matches are always consistent (#PyDev-634).

* Fixed issue renaming top-level module on refactoring.

* Refactoring has option to rename variable to a standard case style.

* Improved the parser that extracted the outline for global tokens to deal with async and consider declarations inside ifs.

* Code completion of properties with @property no longer shows arguments parenthesis (#PyDev-453).

* Preventing a freeze if some code-analysis takes too much time (#PyDev-636).

* Ctrl+1 can be used to wrap/unwrap the contents of brackets (patch by yohell).
