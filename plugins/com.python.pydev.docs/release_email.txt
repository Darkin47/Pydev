PyDev 5.3.1 Released

Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

* **Important** PyDev now requires Java 8 and Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) onwards.

    * PyDev 5.2.0 is the last release supporting Eclipse 4.5 (Mars).

* **Code Completion**
 
    * Substring completions are **on by default** (may be turned off in the code-completion preferences).
    * Fixed issue with code-completion using from..import..as aliases.
    
* **Others**
    
    * Auto-fix imports with Ctrl+Shift+O properly sorts items based on the same sorting improvements for code-completion.
    * When fixing unresolved import (with Ctrl+1) it properly resolves dependent projects (bugfix for regression in 5.3.0).
    * **async** and **await** keywords are properly highlighted.
    * **async** blocks properly auto-indented.
    * In PEP 448 list unpack variable was not being marked as a "Load" variable (which made the code analysis yield false positives).
