What is PyDev?

What is LiClipse?
---------------------------

LiClipse is a PyDev standalone with goodies such as support for Multiple cursors, theming and a number of other languages such as Django Templates, Kivy Language, Mako Templates, Html, Javascript, etc.

It's also a commercial counterpart which helps supporting the development of PyDev.

Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

* **Important**: PyDev requires Eclipse 3.8 or 4.3 onwards and Java 7! For older versions, keep using PyDev 2.x (use LiClipse: http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse for a PyDev standalone with all requirements bundled).

* **Minimap**

    * Minimap is enabled by default.
    * The minimap now shows content based on the outline.
    * It's possible to customize the minimap selection color.
    * Fixed issue where the background in the minimap could have a part with a different color until the image was fully redrawn.
    * Scrollbars hidden by default.
    
* **Editor**

    * Auto code-completion on all letter chars is enabled by default.

* **Debugger**

    * Merged debugger code with the PyCharm fork.
    * Fix the wrong signature of stackless.get_schedule_callback.
    * Breakpoints work in Django templates (requires the LiClipse: http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse/ html/django editor to work).
    * Gevent debugging (must be enabled in the debugger preferences page).
    * Faster debugging when dealing with huge dicts/sets/lists/tuples.
    * QThreads can be debugged (for remote debugging, 'import pydevd' must be done before any user code is executed for it to work).
    
* **Interactive Console**

    * Output is gotten asynchronously.
    * It's possible to interrupt the console.

* **Others**

    * Autopep8 now works with non ascii sources.
    * More than 20 levels of indentation no longer causes ArrayOutOfBoundsException.
    * Fixed some NullPointerExceptions.
    * A bunch of other bugfixes.
