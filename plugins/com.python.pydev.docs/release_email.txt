PyDev 3.5.0 Released



What is PyDev?
---------------------------

PyDev is an open-source Python IDE on top of Eclipse for Python, Jython and IronPython development.

It comes with goodies such as code completion, syntax highlighting, syntax analysis, code analysis, refactor, debug, interactive console, etc.

What is LiClipse?
---------------------------

LiClipse is a PyDev standalone with goodies such as support for Multiple cursors, theming and a number of other languages such as Django Templates, Kivy Language, Mako Templates, Html, Javascript, etc.

It's also a commercial counterpart which helps supporting the development of PyDev.

Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

- **Important**: PyDev requires Eclipse 3.8 or 4.3 onwards and Java 7! For older versions, keep using PyDev 2.x (or LiClipse for a PyDev standalone with all requirements bundled).

* Adding plead for the current crowdfunding at http://tiny.cc/pydev-2014.

* PyDev now has a new logo.

* **py.test**:

    * Improved py.test test runner preferences page.
    
    * py.test integration improved to be less intrusive and work with xdist.
    
    * py.test protocol invocation now allows for module/session scoped fixtures to work properly.

* Add bookmark and add task actions are shown in the ruler context menu (**Ctrl+F10**).
    
* Code completion was not properly recognizing variables assigned to self inside an elif statement.

* Django 1.7: Model.objects is manually patched inside PyDev to give proper code-completion results.

* Debugger: hovering over private ('__' prefixed) variables now shows proper value.

* Thread.isAlive() is no longer called to workaround debugger issue on Python 3.4.

* Hyperlinking should not happen on spacing characters (I.e.: Ctrl+click on spaces).

* Fixed NPE when interpreter is created with JDT and loaded afterwards without it.

* Fixed issue where tokens cached information could end up being null after I/O.

* Manually creating new run configuration no longer gives an exception (i.e.: configuration without associated project).

* Out-of-sync error on PYTHONPATH change (patch by Danny Yoo)

* There's an extension point for clients to resolve modules (patch by Danny Yoo).

* **Ctrl+Shift+G** (find references) is now properly categorized.

* Rename refactoring now validates files (read only) prior to refactoring (patch by Danny Yoo).

* Not checking preferred settings when the PyDev plugin is started, but rather when a PyDev editor is opened.

* Setting remote debugger socket to be properly reused.

* The PyDev stdout/stderr redirector now properly uses PYTHONIOENCODING.
