Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

* **Important**: PyDev requires Eclipse 3.8 or 4.3 onwards and Java 7! For older versions, keep using PyDev 2.x.

* **Refactoring**:

    * It's now possible to rename a module (using F2 or drag and drop in the pydev package explorer).
    
    * Multiple improvements on the rename refactoring.

* **Debugger**:

    * **Automatic code reloading on the debugger** (based on xreload).
    
        * When a file is changed and a debug session is on, PyDev will automatically reload it (based on xreload).
        
        * View https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/blob/development/plugins/org.python.pydev/pysrc/pydevd_reload.py for caveats/limitations.
    
    * **Get referrers on debug**
    
        * Right-click expression or variable in debugger and select 'Get Referrers'
        
        * Note: may not work on some Python variants as it needs access to the gc module.
    
    * **Stackless python** is now supported in the debugger, showing all the suspended tasklets in the stack view.
    
    * Automatically force focus to Eclipse on breakpoint hit (Enable in prefereces > pydev > debug).
    
    * The remote debugger can be left 'always on' (Enable in prefereces > pydev > debug).
    
    * If there's an exception while evaluating a conditional breakpoint the thread is suspended and the issue reported. 
    
    * Option to skip caught exceptions thrown and handled in the same context.
    
    * A comment with @IgnoreException can be added to lines where an exception is thrown to have that exception ignored by the debugger when caught exceptions support is turned on.  

    * Improved visualization of frame objects.
    
    * Bug-fixes on Jython debugging.
    
* **Unittest**:

    * Django: The default PyDev unittest runner can now run Django tests properly
    
    * Selecting a unit-test method in the editor and **right-click > run as unit-test** will run only the selected unit-test.
    
    * **Ctrl+F9** with test selected will pre-select only that test to run in unit-test.
    
    
* **General**:

    * Improvements on search for references (Ctrl+Shift+G).
    
    * Fixed some racing conditions related to the plugin startup.
    
    * Organize imports has option to add from imports before other imports.
    
    * Improved connection to shell that does code-completion. 
    
    * Properly supporting creation of shell inside a Jython VM in Eclipse.
