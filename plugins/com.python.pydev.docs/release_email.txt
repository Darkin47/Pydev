PyDev 3.4.1 Released



What is PyDev?
---------------------------

PyDev is an open-source Python IDE on top of Eclipse for Python, Jython and IronPython development.

It comes with goodies such as code completion, syntax highlighting, syntax analysis, code analysis, refactor, debug, interactive console, etc.

What is LiClipse?
---------------------------

LiClipse is a PyDev standalone with goodies such as support for Multiple cursors, theming and a number of other languages such as Django Templates, Kivy Language, Mako Templates, Html, Javascript, etc.

It's also a commercial counterpart which helps supporting the development of PyDev.

Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

- **Important**: PyDev requires Eclipse 3.8 or 4.3 onwards and Java 7! For older versions, keep using PyDev 2.x (or LiClipse for a PyDev standalone with all requirements bundled).


- **Interactive Console**:

    * **Send a single line to the interactive console with F2** (akin to Ctrl+Alt+Enter but only for the current line).


- **Debugger**:

    * **Added support for debugging spawned subprocesses.**

    	* New Django launches no longer have -noreload to take advantage of that (but existing launches have to be manually edited -- or removed and recreated).

    * When terminating a process its subprocesses are also killed (avoiding django zombie processes).

    * In the debugger, locals are now also properly saved on PyPy (requires a newer version of PyPy too).

    * Remote Debugger: when specifying items in PATHS_FROM_ECLIPSE_TO_PYTHON pathnames are normalized.

    * Fixes to work with Jython 2.1 and Jython 2.2.1

    * Always setting PYTHONUNBUFFERED environment variable to 1.

    * The python default encoding is no longer changed (only PYTHONIOENCODING is used now and not sys.setdefaultencoding).

    * Minor improvements on get referrers.


- **General**:

    * **Cython: .pxd and .pxi files are properly supported.**

    * Interpreter configuration: It's possible to reorder PYTHONPATH entries with drag and drop.

    * Fixed django interactive shell to work with newer versions of Django.

    * Rename working properly for files without extensions.

    * Fixed issue where specifying the type of a variable with a comment was not detected in the code-completion.

    * Fixed issue where we'd open a file as if it was an external file when it was actually a file in the workspace or inside a source folder.

    * PyDev Package Explorer: fixed issue where some errors would remain showing when they didn't exist anymore.

    * PyDev Package Explorer: fixed issue where items could change its order depending on decorations.

    * On a double-click on spaces, all the spaces are selected.


- **Test Runner**:

    * **Improved py.test integration**: it's now possible to select which tests to run with Ctrl+F9 (even if not under a class).

    * No longer breaks if a file which was in a launch config is removed (still runs other tests in the launch).

    * After a test run finishes, if there are non-daemon threads running they're printed to the output.

    * Fixed UnicodeDecodeError when running unit-tests under python 2.x

    * Fixed issue on test discovery on Linux.


- **Sorting Imports**:

    * Sort of imports no longer adds spaces at end of imports.

    * Sort of imports no longer passes the number of available columns specified.

    * It's now also possible to keep the names of 'from' imports sorted.
